# in-and-outs
Personal project - Accountancy app - Keep track of all the incomes and expenses  
  
This is a work in progress.  
Entry-point: BST_Prg  
  
The program will allow the user to read/write data using a simple GUI.  
Data will be stored in a text file on the hdd.  
At program start all data will be loaded inside a binary search tree and displayed on the GUI.  
  
  
#### Current stage:
At the moment the program loads some data from 2 temporary arrays and displays it on the GUI.  
It's possible to search/insert/delete values from the BST and display all data through preorder/inorder/postorder tree traversal.  
The result of the search/insert/delete operations is showed on the console.  
  
#### //TODO:  
* Get rid of the 2 temporary arrays and implement reading/writing to file on hdd  
* Upgrade GUI from awt to JavaFX  
* Fix BST bug (deleting the root of the BST causes some issues)  
* ...
